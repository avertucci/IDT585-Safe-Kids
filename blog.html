                    </h2>
                    <p>Currently, many of our members and coalition leaders utilize information technology deliverable methods in their training and programs. However, there are many other examples of these types of technological techniques and their applications that are indicated below.
Personalization for members
Members can have the ability to create a individualized profile that helps track, bookmark, get involved with, research, and discuss various childhood preventative measures by different deliverables whether our large article database, on-demand or LIVE media streaming, local focus group scheduling, and more. The idea behind personalized profiles is to create a feature rich user experience to allow members to get the information they are most interested about while also providing avenues to learn more by finding and presenting relatable information.
Virtual Meetings
Not all members or prospects have the ability to travel large distances and be available for every meeting and any location. Provide a more ease-of-access domain can help grow the user base and engage more users on a larger scale. This scalability can act as a catalyst in the overall improvement of a children’s wellbeing by providing better access to those professional’s and programs.
IPA Usage
Intelligent personal assistants are becoming more and more of not only a trend but a necessity for the information age by providing automated information and push notifications for real-time data driven metrics. For kid safety, we are looking at expanding a network of wearable technology and make these more readily accessible for our members to help provide real-time children location access understanding, and usage. With increasing our partner outlets while also providing new technological areas for childhood safety we not only can increase our brand, but continue increasing our preventative success metric.</p>

                    <p>OUR GOALS
While our current technology examples only provided a minimal look-in of what their is available, those components are without a doubt unheard of or not understood. Through our various programs such as Button Battery Safety, Child Pedestrian Safety, CPS Certification Safety, Fire Safety, Home Safety, In and Around Cars, Medication Safety, Sports Safety, Start Safe, TV and Furniture Safety, and Liquid Laundry Packet Safety and in conjunction with our partners:

Safe Kids Worldwide looks to be a single repository for everyday awareness, learning and training for childhood preventive care. We need to continue that score value as we continue into the Information Technology era. In the past years the formulation and upkeep of such an organization might have been a large undertaking, and those who have immense knowledge to pass on might not have been able to transfer or store that knowledge for others to take part in, improve on, or continue to distribute. With advances in technology and the onset of the information age this concept can be changed for good. Safe Kids Worldwide looks to take advantage of these advancements in providing extra childhood injury awareness and create a distributable platform that families across the world can co-exist in doing the same task; preventing children fatalities and injuries. Areas of technology involvement are related to personalization profiling, IPAs ( intelligent personal assistants) , usage of the world wide web, and telepresence to help distribute the large data components at a speed and reliability rate that no other organization has been ever able to achieve. </p><a href="#" class="btn btn-default btn-lg">Read More</a>
